Want to take it to the next level and prevent casting into a reflector (or cancel mid cast if you press the macro again)?
```
/run ReflectorCast("frost", "Frostbolt")
```
That's the template macro for your spells, replace the "frost" with "shadow" or "fire" for shadow/fire. Replace "Frostbolt" with your spell.
if you're mid cast you'll need to press the macro again to cancel cast.
